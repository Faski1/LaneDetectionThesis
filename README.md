# LaneDetectionThesis

Project built with Open Computer Vision library for a robot which detects and moves between lanes in a controlled environment.

Code **outdated** and **far from final**, full final preview is available in the [Documentation](https://github.com/Faski1/LaneDetectionThesis/blob/master/Detekcija_saobracajne_trake_za_autonomno_vodjenje_robota.docx) file.
